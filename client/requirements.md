## Packages
framer-motion | Smooth animations for result cards and form transitions
clsx | Utility for constructing className strings conditionally
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes safely

## Notes
The application requires a distinctive "Cyber/Tech" aesthetic.
Backend expects POST /api/generate with { skillLevel, domain, language, projectType }.
Response includes complex nested data (roadmap, tech stack, etc.) which needs rich formatting.
