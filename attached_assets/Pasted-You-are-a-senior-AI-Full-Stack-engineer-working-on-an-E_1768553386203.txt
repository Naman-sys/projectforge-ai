You are a senior AI + Full-Stack engineer working on an EXISTING project
called “AI Project Idea Generator”.

The project already:
- Generates AIML project ideas
- Runs on Replit
- Uses Node + Express backend
- Uses React frontend
- May optionally use a database on Replit

Your task is to UPGRADE the project so that it becomes a
MAJOR AIML-BASED PROJECT and is DEPLOYMENT-SAFE on:

- Replit (development + demo)
- Render (backend)
- Vercel (frontend)

IMPORTANT RULES:
- DO NOT redesign the UI
- DO NOT remove existing features
- DO NOT refactor unless required for deployment safety
- DO NOT add paid services
- DO NOT break Replit compatibility

=====================================
MAIN OBJECTIVE
=====================================

For every generated project idea, the system must also generate:

1. An AIML PROJECT BLUEPRINT
2. AIML CODE TEMPLATES (scaffold, not full apps)
3. A CLEAR ML PIPELINE
4. OPTIONAL DATABASE USAGE (must not crash without DB)

This must qualify as a MAJOR AIML PROJECT academically.

=====================================
WHAT TO GENERATE FOR EACH IDEA
=====================================

When a project idea is generated, ALSO generate:

1️⃣ PROJECT STRUCTURE
- Folder layout for AIML project
- Separate data, model, training, inference layers

2️⃣ AIML PIPELINE DESCRIPTION
- Data collection
- Preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection
- Training
- Evaluation
- Deployment

3️⃣ CODE TEMPLATES (NOT FULL APPS)
Generate reusable, editable templates such as:

- train.py (with model placeholders)
- predict.py
- preprocessing.py
- config.py
- requirements.txt

Templates MUST:
- Use real ML libraries (sklearn, pandas, numpy)
- Contain real code
- Use placeholders for dataset paths and parameters
- NOT require immediate training to run

4️⃣ MODEL & DATASET AWARENESS
- Recommend ML models based on problem type
- Recommend public datasets (Kaggle / UCI)
- Recommend evaluation metrics

=====================================
DEPLOYMENT SAFETY (VERY IMPORTANT)
=====================================

Ensure the backend:

- Always listens on process.env.PORT
- Binds to 0.0.0.0
- Has CORS enabled
- Does NOT crash if DATABASE_URL is missing
- Uses database ONLY if DATABASE_URL exists
- Skips DB logic gracefully otherwise

Ensure the frontend:

- Uses import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL
- Has NO hardcoded localhost URLs
- Is compatible with Vercel

=====================================
DATABASE HANDLING RULES
=====================================

- Replit automatically provides DATABASE_URL
- Render does NOT provide DATABASE_URL by default
- Database usage must be OPTIONAL
- Missing DATABASE_URL must NEVER crash the app
- Database logging must be fire-and-forget

=====================================
WHAT NOT TO DO
=====================================

- Do NOT generate full runnable ML projects for every idea
- Do NOT train models automatically
- Do NOT assume datasets are downloaded
- Do NOT add unnecessary complexity

=====================================
FINAL DELIVERABLE
=====================================

- Minimal, safe backend changes ONLY if required
- Blueprint + AIML code templates added to idea output
- Clear comments explaining why each deployment-safe fix exists
- Same codebase must work on:
  - Replit
  - Render
  - Vercel

The result must clearly qualify as a MAJOR AIML-BASED PROJECT
suitable for final-year evaluation.

Now apply ONLY the necessary changes and show the final output format.
