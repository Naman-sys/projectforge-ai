You are a senior AIML + Full-Stack engineer working on an EXISTING project
called “AI Project Idea Generator”.

The project already:
- Generates intelligent project ideas
- Generates AIML blueprints and code templates
- Uses stack-aware code generation (Python / JS / Web / App)
- Is compatible with Replit, Render (backend), and Vercel (frontend)
- Has deployment-safe backend logic (CORS, PORT, optional DB)

IMPORTANT RULES (DO NOT BREAK THESE):
- DO NOT change UI design
- DO NOT refactor existing features
- DO NOT remove any current functionality
- DO NOT break Replit / Render / Vercel compatibility
- ONLY ADD the features listed below

========================================
OBJECTIVE
========================================

Upgrade the project from “good” to a
CLEAR, UNDENIABLE MAJOR AIML PROJECT
by ADDING intelligence layers and academic depth.

========================================
FEATURES TO ADD (ONLY THESE)
========================================

------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ ONE FULLY IMPLEMENTED AIML DEMO PROJECT
------------------------------------------------

Add support for ONE complete demo AIML project
(selected automatically OR fixed internally).

The demo must include:
- Dataset source (Kaggle / UCI)
- Data preprocessing steps
- Model selection
- Training logic (example code or notebook)
- Evaluation metrics
- Sample results (accuracy, F1, etc.)

IMPORTANT:
- Only ONE project needs full implementation
- Do NOT generate full working projects for every idea
- Demo is used ONLY to prove feasibility

------------------------------------------------
2️⃣ EXPLAINABILITY / JUSTIFICATION LAYER (XAI)
------------------------------------------------

For EVERY generated project idea, add:

- Why this problem is suitable for AIML
- Why the suggested model fits the problem
- Why the dataset is appropriate
- Key assumptions
- Limitations of the approach

This must be simple, student-friendly language.

------------------------------------------------
3️⃣ DIFFICULTY & LEARNING OUTCOMES
------------------------------------------------

For each project idea, automatically generate:

- Difficulty level:
  - Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
- Prerequisite knowledge
- AIML concepts the student will learn
  (e.g., classification, feature engineering, evaluation)

------------------------------------------------
4️⃣ EVALUATION METRICS GENERATOR
------------------------------------------------

For each project idea, generate:

- Recommended evaluation metrics
- Why those metrics are chosen
- What a “good result” looks like

Example:
- Classification → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
- Regression → MAE, RMSE, R²

------------------------------------------------
5️⃣ FUTURE SCOPE (ACADEMIC REQUIREMENT)
------------------------------------------------

For each project idea, generate:

- Possible enhancements
- AutoML integration ideas
- Real-world deployment extensions
- Research improvement directions

========================================
WHAT MUST REMAIN UNCHANGED
========================================

- Existing idea generation logic
- Stack-aware code generation behavior
- Deployment safety logic
- Database optional handling
- Frontend behavior
- API structure

========================================
CONSTRAINTS
========================================

- Do NOT add authentication
- Do NOT add payments
- Do NOT add unnecessary complexity
- Do NOT introduce breaking changes
- Do NOT depend on paid services

========================================
EXPECTED RESULT
========================================

The final system must:

- Clearly qualify as a MAJOR AIML PROJECT
- Be defensible in viva/exam
- Demonstrate intelligent decision-making
- Show real AIML understanding
- Remain fully deployable on:
  - Replit
  - Render
  - Vercel

Now implement ONLY these additions and
show the updated output structure.
