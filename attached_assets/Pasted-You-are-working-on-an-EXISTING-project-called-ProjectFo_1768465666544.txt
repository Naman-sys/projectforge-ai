You are working on an EXISTING project called "ProjectForge AI"
built using Replit with React (frontend) and a logic-based backend.

DO NOT rewrite the entire project.
DO NOT change the UI layout.
DO NOT introduce new frameworks.
ONLY enhance existing logic and UI safely.

========================
OBJECTIVE
========================

Upgrade the current project idea generator by adding:

1. AIML-SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE
2. DATASET SUGGESTIONS
3. COPY TO CLIPBOARD FEATURE

========================
REQUIRED CHANGES
========================

1️⃣ AIML INTELLIGENCE (BACKEND LOGIC)

- When Target Domain = "AIML":
  - Automatically include:
    - ML/DL model names (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CNN, RNN)
    - Learning types (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement)
    - Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
  - Models should vary based on:
    - Skill Level
      - Beginner → Classical ML
      - Intermediate → Ensemble models
      - Advanced → Deep Learning / Hybrid models

- Ensure generated descriptions explicitly mention:
  - Dataset usage
  - Model training
  - Prediction or recommendation outputs

2️⃣ DATASET SUGGESTIONS SECTION

- Add a new output section titled: "Suggested Datasets"
- Show this section ONLY if domain = AIML
- Datasets should be realistic and public:
  - Kaggle datasets
  - UCI ML Repository
  - Public CSV datasets
- Each dataset entry should include:
  - Dataset name
  - Short description

3️⃣ COPY TO CLIPBOARD (FRONTEND)

- Add a "Copy Project Idea" button below the generated output
- On click:
  - Copy all generated content (title, description, features, tech stack, roadmap)
  - Show a small success message (e.g., "Copied to clipboard!")

- Use browser-native clipboard API
- Do NOT add new UI libraries

========================
CONSTRAINTS
========================

- Keep existing files and structure
- Modify ONLY necessary logic
- Code must be error-free
- Maintain current styling
- Use clean, readable code
- No placeholders

========================
DELIVERABLE
========================

Provide:
- Exact code changes for backend logic
- Exact code changes for frontend copy button
- Clear comments explaining what was added

IMPORTANT:
- This is a FREE project
- Do NOT suggest paid APIs
- Do NOT remove existing functionality

Now implement these upgrades safely.
