You are enhancing an EXISTING project called "ProjectForge AI".
The project already generates software project ideas.

DO NOT refactor the app.
DO NOT change the UI layout.
DO NOT add new dependencies.
ONLY improve the intelligence and realism of generated AIML ideas.

========================
OBJECTIVE
========================

Make AIML project ideas feel:
- Research-oriented
- Industry-grade
- Resume-ready

========================
REQUIRED INTELLIGENCE UPGRADES
========================

1️⃣ MODEL-AWARE IDEA GENERATION

When Target Domain = "AIML", every generated project MUST include:

- Learning Type:
  - Supervised / Unsupervised / Semi-Supervised / Reinforcement

- Models (chosen based on skill level):
  - Beginner:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - K-Means
  - Intermediate:
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost
    - Gradient Boosting
  - Advanced:
    - CNN
    - LSTM / GRU
    - Transformer-based models

- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision / Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC (if classification)

2️⃣ DATA PIPELINE SECTION

Add a new section in the output called **"ML Pipeline"** containing:
- Data collection
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Deployment strategy

3️⃣ DATASET-DRIVEN DESCRIPTIONS

Ensure every AIML description:
- Mentions dataset size/type (e.g., structured, text, images)
- References realistic public datasets:
  - Kaggle
  - UCI ML Repository
  - Open datasets

4️⃣ PROBLEM-TO-MODEL ALIGNMENT

Automatically align:
- Problem type → model choice
  - Prediction → Regression / Classification
  - Recommendation → Collaborative filtering
  - NLP → TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Transformers
  - Computer Vision → CNNs

5️⃣ ADVANCED-LEVEL DEPTH (ONLY FOR ADVANCED)

If Skill Level = Advanced, include:
- Model optimization (hyperparameter tuning)
- Cross-validation
- Model explainability (SHAP / LIME)
- Scalability considerations

========================
CONSTRAINTS
========================

- Keep everything deterministic and rule-based
- No LLM APIs
- No paid services
- No placeholders
- Maintain current JSON response structure
- No breaking changes

========================
DELIVERABLE
========================

Provide:
- Updated backend logic only
- Clean, readable code
- Inline comments explaining intelligence upgrades

IMPORTANT:
- This must work on free Replit tier
- Do NOT touch frontend code
- Do NOT summarize — provide actual code

Now apply these intelligence upgrades safely.
